    <!-- The $ is a convention that indicates departments$ is an Observable, not an array. -->
    <!-- The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable. But there's also a pipe character (|) followed by async, which identifies Angular's AsyncPipe. -->
    <!-- The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have to do so in the component class. -->
    <!-- The async pipe subscribes to an Observable or Promise and returns the latest value it has emitted. When a new value is emitted, the async pipe marks the component to be checked for changes -->
    <!-- When the component gets destroyed, the async pipe unsubscribes automatically to avoid potential memory leaks. -->
